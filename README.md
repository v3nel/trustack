# This is a WIP.

# Overview

## Problem

Today, a lot of freelancers are stopped in their activity to deal with problems that shouldn't take that long. Mainly the client relation and the endless meetings. In fact, clients want their product finished and can be a little pushy about the milestones of their project.

## Solution

I've made to the conclusion that freelancers need a platform that would make these problems go away. I decided to call it "Trustack". This name explains the solution that I'm willing to bring. A platform that will make clients trust their freelancers. So we got "Trust" for the client-side and "Stack" for the professional-side. So Trustack is the solution to bring these two sides together and bring transparency.

## Format

This app will be web-based, only freelancers will have to create an account as it will be useless to get each client to sign in to the platform and will bring new unnecessary steps in the process of starting the project.

## Features

Trustack will bring core features to bring the solution detailed right above.

Firstly, the freelancer and the client will each get a different view of the infos of the project which will be created by the freelancer. However, he will have to get the email address of the client so a link to access his view of dashboard, the freelancer can also send it personally to him by copying it using the dedicated button on his interface. While the freelancer has full access to the data of the dashboard, the client has a read-only view of the advancement of the professional. This dashboard will integrate all of the core data of the project as well as a detailed list of the tasks that has been redacted by the employee.

Next, the app will include a system of payment milestones. These are optional, but can be really useful if you fear to not be paid on time or if the client magically disappears when you're finished working.

Also, the app will integrate a chat for you and your client where you will be able to communicate about certain tasks or part of the mission.

And finally, the app will include an escrow system, so all of the client related features are handled in Trustack.

## The technical stack

### Front-end

Trustack is based on a simple fronted using Next.js and ShadCN UI library. This is perfect for a sober and corporate design that I wanted to give to this app. This choice of UI Library is also the perfect choice for a clear and comprehensive dashboard and a clarity of information readability.

### Back-end

Trustack back-end's stack will be based on Express.js and will use a PostgreSQL database. This is perfect for a fast response time.
